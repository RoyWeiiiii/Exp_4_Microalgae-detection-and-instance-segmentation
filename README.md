This study harnesses the advanced capabilities of the YOLOv8 model to enhance real-time detection and instance segmentation of microalgae species, specifically Chlorella vulgaris FSP-E, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Spirulina platensis. Comprehensive evaluations revealed that the original RGB dataset provided better detection accuracy compared to augmented and pre-processed datasets. The YOLOv8-n box detection achieved high accuracy with precision, recall, F1 score, mAP50, and mAP50-95 of 0.866, 0.0.871, 0.868, 0.919, and 0.732, respectively. Nonetheless, YOLOv8-n box instance segmentation demonstrated superior performance with precision, recall, F1 score, mAP50, and mAP50-95 of 0.884, 0.914, 0.889, 0.950, and 0.812, respectively. YOLOv8-n outperformed its predecessors YOLOv5-s and YOLOv7, in terms of overall performance with lower computational cost and faster inference speed, yet still able to deliver high accuracy results on densely populated microalgae samples.
